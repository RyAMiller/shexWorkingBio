# Introduction

[ShEx](http://shex.io/) is one the systems to write shape expressions. Shape expressions describe ("express")
how a piece of RDF can take form ("shape"). The people that have worked with eXtensible Markup Language (XML)
in the past know the approach as schema, as in Document Type Definitions (DTD), XML Schema, or Schematron.
The people that know SPARQL, a shape expression is quite similar, but instead of asking for data, the
structure describes what data is expected. The people that do not know either, a shape expression basically
explains what information we expect for a certain resource.

This document gives a number of example shapes for frameworks bioinformaticians may work with.
